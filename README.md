## 💡 Concept
I decided to create a concept around the MovieDatabase API and combine this with a realtime implication. I created 3 concepts and created 1 concepts out of these 3 concepts.

### Movie guesser by poster
All the user get to see a random movie poster. The users have to guess which movie it is. The first user to guess it right wins and get a point. If none of the users manage to guess it right within 20 seconds, no one will get any points.

### Videochat hints
One user gets to see one movie and this user has to visualize the movie through video. The others have to guess which movie the other user is visualizing. The user who guesses the movie first gets the points. If no one mananged to guess te movie in 30 seconds, no on will get any points.

### Guess release year
All the users get to see the movie poster and name. The user who guesses the release year of the movie as first, gets the points. If no one guesses the year in 20 seconds, no one will get any points.
